- English words are irregular,but useful.

- search the world in a dict when first seeing it or miss a chance to enhance impression.

- A good way to learn it is repeating,another one is getting into the env.
- To use it is more important than being local,or being clear about the meaning of every single word. we know what each other means ,then it's ok.(in most cases)

- when meeting a half-familiar word,if it's possible to deduce the meaning.dont collect, since there's so many words like this.
